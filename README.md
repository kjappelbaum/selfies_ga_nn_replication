# Requirements 

The main dependencies are PyTorch, RDKit, and SELFIES. 

## Linux

To create a conda environment with all dependencies run 

```bash
conda env create -n selfies_ga_replication -f environment_ubuntu.yml
```

## Mac OS 

To create a conda environment with all dependencies run 

```bash
conda env create -n selfies_ga_replication -f environment_mac.yml
```

(We used the Mac environment mostly for data analysis.)


# Experiments

In addition to the main experiments from the paper we ran some additional ones investigating a novel adapative penalty, the influence of the model architecture, and the influence of the labeling convention. 

1. [Experiment 1: Baseline and basic SELFIES GA](./experiment_1)
2. [Experiment 2: Time adaptive penalty](./experiment_2)
3. [Experiment 3: Unsupervised analysis (clustering)](./experiment_3)
3. [Experiment 4: Constrained optimization](./experiment_4)

We re ran the experiments using [Weights and Biases]() tracking, if you also want to use this, you'll need to setup wandb on your machine (`pip install wandb`, followed by `wandb login`). Typically we ran experiments in the following way from the root directory 

```bash
python -m experiments.experiment_1.ga.core_ga
```
