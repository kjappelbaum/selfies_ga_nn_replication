# Flipping the objective

Here we run the same experiment as with the beta sweeps but we flip the way in which we train the discriminator. 
Now long surving molecules obtain a score of 1 and the reference dataset a score of zero and we will investigate positive and negative beta. This is, for negative beta we effectively *penalize* long surviving molecules.
